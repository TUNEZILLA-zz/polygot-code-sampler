ðŸŽ­ Code Opera Performance Notes:
========================================

Voice Choir:
- Rust: Deep, powerful bass (dense texture, reverb+distortion)
- Python: Smooth, expressive tenor (smooth texture, chorus+delay)
- Julia: Mathematical, precise soprano (fractal texture, lfo+reverb)
- TypeScript: Modern, versatile alto (polyphonic texture, chorus+delay)
- Go: Steady, reliable baritone (sparse texture, reverb)
- C#: Rich, enterprise bass (maximal texture, distortion+reverb)
- SQL: Structured, harmonic foundation (minimal texture, reverb)

Harmony Structure:
- C (Rust) - Root note, powerful foundation
- E (Python) - Major third, smooth expression
- G (Julia) - Perfect fifth, mathematical precision
- A (TypeScript) - Major sixth, modern versatility
- D (Go) - Perfect fourth, steady reliability
- F (C#) - Major second, enterprise richness
- B (SQL) - Major seventh, harmonic foundation

Visual Effects:
- Each voice has unique particle behavior and color
- Particles 'sing' in sync with code loops
- Harmony visualization shows combined effects
- Real-time performance controls for live coding
