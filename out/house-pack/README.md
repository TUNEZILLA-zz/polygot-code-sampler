# 🎹 FOH House Pack - Two Hotkeys to Rule Them All

## 🚪 Quick Start (Two Commands)

```bash
make doors-open
```
- Runs 60s sanity check
- Opens VJ Neofetch compact overlay
- Preloads showlet fullscreen
- Platform personality active

### Doors Close
```bash
make doors-close
```
- Extended Encore (Chaos + Tape Dream + Cathedral)

## 📋 FOH Reference

- **Operator Card**: `foh_operator_card.html` - Print/laminate for stage use
- **Run of Show**: `foh_run_of_show.html` - Conductor's score with timings
- **QA Matrix**: `quirk_qa_matrix.html` - 6-tab platform validation
- **VJ Neofetch**: `vj_neofetch_enhanced.html` - System monitoring overlay

## 🎭 VJ Quirks System

- **Auto-detect**: Platform personality with A11y guards
- **Tiny badge**: Top-right confirmation (fades after 2s)
- **Telemetry**: Console logs for monitoring
- **Performance**: Auto-throttle when FPS < 50

## 🛡️ Safety Rails (Always Active)

- Strobe ≤ 8 Hz, duty ≤ 35% / 10s
- Motion-reduced fades ≤ 490 ms
- Frame p95 guard trims trails/particles automatically
- A11y compliance: ✅
- Mono fallback: ✅

## 🎛️ Pro Tips

- Print both cards at 100% scale, laminate matte
- Keep Neofetch compact on side monitor as health badge
- If FPS dips, add `?reduced=1` to any backdrop URL
- Fail-safe finale: [Shift+E] → Extended Encore → Blackout
