ðŸš€ **Major Milestone: Enterprise Performance Monitoring Platform**

We just transformed the Polyglot Code Sampler from a simple compiler demo into a world-class, enterprise-grade performance monitoring platform that rivals observability systems used by major tech companies.

**What we built:**
â€¢ Policy-driven governance with centralized configuration
â€¢ Intelligent regression detection with infrastructure awareness
â€¢ Interactive performance dashboard with real-time insights
â€¢ Zero-friction contributor experience with demo data
â€¢ Enterprise-grade security with audit trails and approval gates

**Try it now:** `make demo-data && make demo-serve`

This isn't just a toolâ€”it's a complete performance observability ecosystem that teams will copy and showcase as the gold standard.
